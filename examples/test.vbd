These lines at the top of the file are ignored because
they do not contain a pipe character.  This gives a
fair amount of flexibility in inserting comments.

Below is a line that contains a pipe character, so
it gets interpreted by the calendar tool.  The name
of the 'event' is on the right-hand side of the pipe.
On the left-hand side would be the options.  However
there are no options.  This means there are no
restrictions for when the event appears, so it will
appear every day.

| Hello

Now if the lookahead option is added on the left-hand
side it will cause the 'event' to be anounced in
advance.  The option specifies the number of days
ahead it will match.

lookahead=5 | Hello   (advance warning)

If an exact date is given then we will be able to
restrict the event to that point.  Note that the first
Monday event won't be shown until the day itself,
because there is no lookahead.

isodate=2011-09-18 | It is a Sunday
isodate=2011-09-19 | It is a Monday
isodate=2011-09-19 lookahead=4 | It is still a Monday

Now let's add a bit more power with recurring events.
It is possible to specify the weekday that matches
an event.  Sunday=0, ..., Saturday=6

lookahead=14 weekday=0 | This is always on a Sunday
